# Transformer Language Model

This repository contains the implementation of a Transformer-based language model built with PyTorch. The model is designed to generate text based on a dataset provided by the user. The architecture consists of multi-head self-attention layers, feed-forward layers, and embedding layers.

## Overview

This project implements a Transformer-based model for text generation. The model is trained on a character-level dataset and can generate new sequences of text by predicting the next character given a sequence of previous characters.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.7+
- CUDA (optional, for GPU support)

Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch
```

## Training

To train the model, simply run the `train_model` function defined in `model.py`. This function will train the model for the specified number of epochs and save the model weights to `model_weights.pth`.

```python
python model.py
```

The training process includes:

- Loading the dataset from `dataset.txt`.
- Splitting the data into training and validation sets.
- Training the model using the Adam optimizer.
- Saving the trained model weights.

## Model Architecture

The model is based on the Transformer architecture and consists of the following components:

- **Embedding Layers**: Maps input characters to dense vectors.
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Captures relationships between different positions in the input sequence.
- **Feed-Forward Layers**: Applies non-linear transformations to the data.
- **Layer Normalization**: Normalizes inputs to the layers for faster convergence.
- **Final Linear Layer**: Maps the output of the last block to the vocabulary size.

### Total Parameters

The model has a total of **17,196,424** parameters.

## Usage

To generate text using the trained model, use the `generate` method. This will generate a sequence of text based on the learned distribution from the training data.

```python
model = Model()
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model_weights.pth'))
print(model.generate(max_tokens=100))
```

## Parameters

Key hyperparameters used in the model:

- `batch_size`: 64
- `block_size`: 256
- `epochs`: 5000
- `learning_rate`: 3e-4
- `n_embed`: 384
- `n_heads`: 6
- `n_layers`: 6
- `dropout`: 0.2
- `train_ratio`: 0.9

These parameters can be adjusted in `model.py` to optimize performance.

## Results

During training, the model's loss is printed every 500 epochs. The final model is capable of generating coherent sequences of text based on the training data.

Sample output from the trained model:

```
Epoch: 5000, Loss: 1.8405
Generated Text: results.txt
```
